- BUG fix form submission to the server using actions (formtype = ReactForm)
- fix client side navigation for the actions apiClient.login and apiClient.update
- on logout, should navigate to the home page.
- use useNavigation in forms to handle errors from the action button, if there was no redirect.
  especially for signup / login forms, as well as profile edit

- for exercices, when showing all questions for an exercise, save to the database after each question is no longer focused
  -- however this shouldnt feel like a navigation, so the action should be called using useFetcher.
