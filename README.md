### Node Express template project

This project is based on a GitLab [Project Template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html).

Improvements can be proposed in the [original project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/express).

### CI/CD with Auto DevOps

This template is compatible with [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/).

If Auto DevOps is not already enabled for this project, you can [turn it on](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/#enabling-auto-devops) in the project settings.


## Still looking for a good project idea



## Technologies

- **Node** and **Express**, using **Typescript** for server-side
- I don't know yet about database system used. I only have practical experience with Oracle DB and Mysql, I'd like to learn a more modern tech here.
(PostgreSql or MongoDb depending on schema ? What are Firebase and Apollo ?)
- For front-end, probably Next.js or React, I don't have any experience with these kind of frameworks yet but they sound interesting.

Add CI/CD toolchain within a Docker container for easy deployment.

- Is there any verification tool I could use ? what of Jenkins ?
